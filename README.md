For my final project I want to focus on the theme of nature. I hope to elicit a feeling of calmness and positivity that comes with being outside and enjoying the outdoors. I will use mainly warm colors and soft textures that complement the environment. Each of my three drawings will depict a landscape with additional overlapping media that correlates to the mood of the specific scene in the forms of music, SVG shapes and doodles. I have always loved the playful aspect of doodling on paper so I want to bring that to the web to evoke a similar experience reminding one of sketchbooks or journals. I plan to use Adobe Photoshop to create layers by outlining elements of the landscape with the pen tool to bring out a new dimension and later animating them as the user interacts with the page. Also, incorporating music to the scene will amplify the emotional aspect. I will primarily be using the tools of HTML Canvas to layer raster graphics, videos and shapes and use pixel manipulation to add a “scrapbook” feeling to the drawing. For the main menu navigation page, I plan to include JavaScript interaction and animation techniques for the user to enjoy while navigating between the different web pages. I hope this project brings a smile to the users face as they remember to enjoy the simple pleasure of admiring nature combined with pen and paper doodles.
