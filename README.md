For my final project I want to focus on the theme of nature in its different forms. I hope to elicit a feeling of calmness and positivity that comes with being outside and enjoying the outdoors. I will use all of my own photos and videos that I have gathered over the years and overlap them to complement each environment. Each of my three drawings will depict a landscape with additional media that correlates to the mood of the specific scene in the forms of music, SVG shapes, images and video. Each landscape will show how movement, static imagery and geometry are interconnected in nature. I will be incorporating music to the scene to amplify the emotional and meditative aspect. I will primarily be using the tools of HTML Canvas to layer raster graphics, videos and shapes and use pixel composting and opacity to convey a “scrapbook” feeling to the drawing. For the main menu navigation page, I plan to include JavaScript interaction that alludes to each environment in color while navigating between the different web pages. I hope this project brings a smile to the users face as they remember to enjoy the simple beauty and pleasure of admiring nature.
